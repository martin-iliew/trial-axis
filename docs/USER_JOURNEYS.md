| Step | Screen                               | User Action                                                                                    | System Response                                                                                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Clinic Dashboard (`/clinic/profile`) | Clinic admin logs in for the first time                                                        | If no clinic profile exists: show empty setup form with completion indicator. If profile exists: show pre-filled form. |
| 2    | Profile Form                         | Admin fills in: clinic name, city, address, description, contact email, contact phone, website | Form validates: name, city, contact email required                                                                     |

_Preconditions: Clinic admin logged in. Postconditions: `clinics` row created/updated, `clinic_specializations` rows updated._

### 4.2 Manage Equipment Inventory

_Preconditions: Clinic profile exists. Postconditions: `equipment` rows created/updated/deleted._

> **MVP Note:** Equipment type is a free-text field. No `equipment_types` catalog table is required for MVP. Consistent naming across seed data is enforced manually.

## 6. Hackathon Build Plan

Aligned with ROADMAP.md phases. The demo story: a sponsor creates a trial, runs matching, finds a clinic, sends an inquiry, and the clinic accepts.

### Phase 1: DB Schema + Seed (~4 hours)

1. Define all tables in `supabase/schema.sql`
2. Seed `therapeutic_areas` catalog and demo accounts
3. Seed **8–10 clinics with meaningfully distinct profiles** (mix of urban/rural, oncology specialists vs. generalists, high-capacity vs. boutique) to ensure matching produces varied, non-obvious results
4. Seed 2–3 sample trial projects with different requirement sets
5. Apply via `npx supabase db reset`
6. Generate TypeScript types

> **Note:** Equipment type is free-text for MVP — no `equipment_types` catalog table needed. Enforce consistent naming in seed data manually.

### Phase 2: Auth & Role-Based Routing (~2 hours)

1. Register page with role picker (Sponsor / Clinic Admin)
2. Login page
3. Middleware for route protection by role
4. Role-aware navbar (include "Get in Touch" link visible to all)

### Phase 2.5: Landing Page Skeleton (~1 hour)

1. Hero section with EUR 8M/day stat prominently displayed
2. Dual CTA: "Join as Sponsor" / "Register Your Clinic"
3. Basic how-it-works outline (can be fleshed out in Phase 7)

> **Why here:** Judges and evaluators may open the URL cold before the full demo. A bare-bones landing page ensures there is always a coherent entry point, even if Phase 7 polish is cut due to time pressure.

### Phase 3: Clinic Profile Management (~3 hours)

1. Clinic profile form with specializations (multi-select from `therapeutic_areas`)
2. Equipment management tab (free-text type, name, quantity, availability toggle)
3. Certifications and availability tab

### Phase 4: Trial Project Management (~3 hours)

1. Trial project creation form
2. Edit flow for Draft projects (reuses creation form, pre-filled)
3. Requirements builder (type, value, priority)
4. My projects list + project detail page (includes inquiry status section with response messages)

### Phase 5: Matching Algorithm (~3 hours)

1. `/api/match` route — hard filter + weighted scoring across 5 dimensions
2. On re-run: delete existing `match_results` for the project before inserting new rows
3. Zero-results handling: return empty array, keep project status as Draft
4. Persist results to `match_results`
5. Return ranked list with per-dimension breakdown

### Phase 6: Match Results UI + Partnership Inquiries (~4 hours)

1. Ranked match results page with color-coded score breakdown
2. Clinic profile modal (rendered within match results page)
3. "Send Inquiry" button → disabled/replaced with status badge once inquiry exists for that clinic
4. Inquiry compose form (message, proposed timeline, patient count, notes)
5. Toast notification on successful send
6. Clinic admin inquiry inbox with full trial detail (including timeline and patient count)
7. Accept (optional message) / Decline (required reason) actions
8. Sponsor project detail reflects acceptance message and decline reason

### Phase 7: Landing & Public Pages (~2 hours)

1. Full landing page polish (value prop, how-it-works, dual CTA)
2. Public clinic browse with "Get in Touch" in navbar/footer
3. Contact form

### Phase 8: Polish & Demo Prep (~3 hours)

1. E2E flow: sponsor registers → creates project → runs match → sends inquiry → clinic accepts
2. Loading states and error handling (including zero-results empty state)
3. Responsive layout check
4. Deploy to Vercel + Supabase cloud

## Appendix: Key Decisions & Constraints

| Decision                                          | Rationale                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Equipment type is free-text (no catalog)          | Avoids extra seed complexity for MVP; consistent naming enforced in seed data |
| Matching re-run replaces previous results         | Simpler state management; no result history needed for MVP                    |
| Project editing locked after Searching status     | Prevents requirement changes invalidating existing match results              |
| Landing page skeleton built at Phase 2.5          | Ensures a coherent entry point exists even if Phase 7 is cut                  |
| 8–10 distinct seed clinics                        | Ensures matching produces varied results; fewer produces an unconvincing demo |
| Acceptance message is optional; shown to sponsor  | Symmetric with decline reason; surfaced in inquiry status section             |
| "Send Inquiry" replaced by status badge once sent | Prevents duplicate inquiries; clear visual feedback without silent failure    |
